# Personal Bio Site 2: Making your Personal Bio Site a Single Page Application

## Prerequisite

> :warning: This exercise requires you to have completed the [Part 1: HTML & CSS || Using JS to print projects to the page](personal-bio-site-01.md) exercise

## General Info

### Understanding What A Single Page Application Is
> A single-page application (SPA) is a web application or web site that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. This approach avoids interruption of the user experience between successive pages, making the application behave more like a desktop application. In an SPA, either all necessary code – HTML, JavaScript, and CSS – is retrieved with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions. The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page, although the location hash or the HTML5 History API can be used to provide the perception and navigability of separate logical pages in the application. Interaction with the single page application often involves dynamic communication with the web server behind the scenes.

### Use Git/Github branching
1. You already made a repo for this project for par1 - continue using that
1. You should have that repo on your machine here - `~/workspace/projects/personal`
1. Branch by feature
1. Commit by significant change - or before you accidentally (on purpose) spill moonshine on your computer.

## Features

### Modify your navbar
1.  We really want this to be a single page app.  If you currently have different html files for the different sections its time to remove those other files.
1.  Consolidate all your html files to a single index.html file (put each of the pages into its own div with an id)
1.  Modify your navbar so when you click a link it either a. Hides all divs except the one you clicked on OR b. scrolls down the page to tht specific section.  Totally your choice - just pick one.

### Add webpack
1.  Modify your project to add in webpack - this will involve you changing the file structure (`src/javascripts/main.js`) and convert your css to SCSS files
1.  You will probably have a TON of linting errors - FIX THEM
1.  Once this branch is complete you should be able to run npm start and have your project look exactly the way it did before

### Modify projects
1.  Move your projects array into a projectsData file in helpers.
1.  Create a getProjects method that returns the projects array to whatever dom string builder needs the array
1.  You should have 5 projects in the projects array
1.  2 of the projects should be real projects that you have done - pick two from class that you are especially proud of.  Include screenshots, real links to github, a space for a deployed link (we will deploy these 2 projects right after break)
1.  Completely style how these projects are displayed - like your almost final version.  Since you have real projects in for 2 of these you will know exactly how your projects are going to display

### Update Featured Projects Repos
For the two REAL projects you added in the above step
1.  Make sure they have a NICE README
1.  Make sure they have clean code - fix spacing, indentation, delete commented code
1.  If you are using a group project fork the group project so it is on your github and then you can go in and clean up the code and readme.  Link everything to YOUR version of the group project - NOT the one in the E11 github organization

### STYLE IT REAL NICE
1.  Guess what you have SCSS NOW!!!!!!!
1.  Use it to your advantage and get this page looking better - doesn't have to be 100% perfect but as close as you can
